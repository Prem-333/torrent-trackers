## Torrent Trackers
A simple, regularly updated list of public torrent trackers to improve peer connections and download speed.

## What Are Trackers?
Trackers help your torrent client find peers faster, especially on low-seeded torrents. This list includes active HTTP, HTTPS, and UDP trackers.

## Included
- `Torrent Trackers.txt` â€“ A plain text file with one tracker URL per line.

## How to Use
1. Open your torrent client (e.g., qBittorrent, uTorrent).
2. Add these trackers to your torrent or default settings.
3. Save and restart your client if needed.

## Contribute
Feel free to suggest new trackers or remove inactive ones via pull request.

> **Note**: All trackers are public. Some may go offline from time to time.
